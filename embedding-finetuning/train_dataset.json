BUSINESS\nOur Company\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics,\nwe have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D\ngraphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, artificial\nintelligence, or AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, or AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.\nThe GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human\nintelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing\ncores, are essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data,\ncan serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning is\nbeing adopted by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been immensely difficult with traditional coding.\nSome of the most recent applications of GPU-powered deep learning include recommendation systems, which are AI algorithms trained to\nunderstand the preferences, previous decisions, and characteristics of people and products using data gathered about their interactions, large\nlanguage models, which can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other content based on knowledge gained from\nmassive datasets, and generative AI, which uses algorithms that create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and\nvideos, based on the data they have been trained on.\nNVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to create unique value for the\nmarkets we serve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture\nleveraging our GPUs and software stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end\nmarkets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and\npartners. The large and growing number of developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform\nto our customers.\nInnovation is at our core. We have invested over $37 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are\nessential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 defined modern computer graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in\ncomputer graphics. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU\nfor general purpose computing. This approach significantly accelerates the most demanding high-performance computing, or HPC, applications\nin fields such as aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, our GPUs and networking\naccelerate many of the fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our GPUs and\nassociated software are well suited for deep learning and machine learning, powering the era of AI. While traditional CPU-based approaches no\nlonger deliver advances on the pace described by Moore\u2019s Law, NVIDIA accelerated computing delivers performance improvements on a pace\nahead of Moore\u2019s Law, giving the industry a path forward.\nGamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. GPUs also help underpin the world\u2019s fastest growing\nspectator sport, eSports, which attracts hundreds of millions of viewers to watch top-quality live video gaming. In addition to serving the growing\nnumber of gamers, the market for gaming GPUs is expanding because of the burgeoning population of live streamers, broadcasters, artists and\ncreators.\nResearchers and developers use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating molecular dynamics to climate\nforecasting. With support for more than 2,800 applications - including 23 of the top 25 HPC applications - NVIDIA GPUs enable some of the most\npromising areas of discovery, from climate prediction to materials science and from wind tunnel simulation to genomics. Including GPUs and\nnetworking, NVIDIA powers over 70% of the supercomputers on the global TOP500 list, including 23 of the top 30 systems on the Green500 list.\n4",

Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks before their\nin-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-the-air software updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-\nbottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous\ndriving.\nLeveraging our intellectual property, or IP. We believe our IP is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our customers and partners through\nlicense and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products, or have us do so through a\ncustom development. Such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.\nSales and Marketing\nOur worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-performance and efficient\ncomputing platforms and software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with end customers and\nvarious industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our partner network incorporates each industry's respective OEMs, original device\nmanufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, retailers/distributors, ISVs, internet and CSPs, automotive\nmanufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.\nMembers of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of application engineers and\nsolution architects to assist our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe\nthat the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network\u2019s time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer\nsatisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within\neach platform.\nTo encourage the development of applications optimized for our platforms and software, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships\nin the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage with key software developers to promote and discuss our\nplatforms, as well as to ascertain individual product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes our products\navailable to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the development of AI frameworks, SDKs, and APIs for software applications and\ngame titles that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for developers in industries\nand organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.\nAs NVIDIA\u2019s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to platforms, systems and\nsoftware, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our products are also\nsold direct to CSPs, enterprise customers, retail channels and consumers.\nSeasonality\nOur computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as consumer gaming, enterprise and cloud data centers, professional workstations,\nand automotive. Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production\nschedules of key customers, some of our products for notebooks and game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third\nquarters, and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters. In fiscal year 2023, our supply exceeded our demand in several areas, and our\nrevenue did not follow historical seasonal patterns. Historical seasonality trends may not repeat.\nManufacturing\nWe do not manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ key\nsuppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the\nexpertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication,\nassembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with\nowning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products,\nsuch as memory, substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the\n9",

As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer\nsupport. We have placed non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums\nand provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future.\nWe have expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations. We utilize suppliers, such as Taiwan\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize\nindependent subcontractors and contract manufacturers, such as Amkor Technology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., or BYD Auto, Hon Hai Precision\nIndustry Co., or Hon Hai, King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics, LLC, Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., and Wistron\nCorporation to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We use contract manufacturers such as Flex\nLtd., Jabil Inc., and Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd., to manufacture our standard and custom adapter card products and switch systems,\nand Fabrinet to manufacture our networking cables. We purchase substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation,\nand Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., or Samsung, and SK Hynix. We\noften consign key components or materials such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit to the contract manufacturers.\nWe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and configuration using test\nequipment purchased from industry-leading suppliers such as Advantest America Inc. and Chroma ATE Inc., and then ship the semiconductors\nto contract manufacturers, such as BYD Auto and Hon Hai, distributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party\nwarehouses in Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit\nand test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions.\nCompetition\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We\nbelieve that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and\ndistribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system\ncosts. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that\ncustomers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at\ncompetitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower\npriced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new\ncompetitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, embedded SoCs, and other\naccelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on\nInfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution\nand manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes. We expect an increasingly\ncompetitive environment in the future.\nOur current competitors include:\n\u2022suppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing\nsolutions, including solutions offered for AI, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n\u2022large cloud services companies with internal teams designing chips and software that incorporate accelerated or AI computing\nfunctionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Inc., and Baidu, Inc.;\n\u2022suppliers of Arm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate CPUs as part of their internal solutions or platforms;\n10",

Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from March 2023 to\nJune 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending\npatent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international\ntreaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be\nmanufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United\nStates. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether\nand where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\u2022the location in which our products are manufactured;\n\u2022our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\n\u2022the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\n\u2022the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government announced new license requirements that impact certain exports to China\n(including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of some of our data center products. The impact of the new license requirements is difficult to\nquantify, and it may be challenging for us to manage our operations and forecast our operating results due to these requirements. Refer to \u201cItem\n1A. Risk Factors- Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\u201d for a discussion of this potential impact.\nAdditionally, our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred\nwhere regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material impact on our business. In February 2022, we\nannounced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges\npreventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-\noff of the prepayment provided at signing.\nCompliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or\ncompetitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

Our goal is to integrate sound environmental, social\nand corporate governance, or ESG, principles and practices into every aspect of the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our practices related to ESG. We assess our\nprograms annually in consideration of stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are important\nfor our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders.\nThe following section and the Human Capital Management Section below provide an overview of our principles and practices. More information\ncan be found on the Corporate Responsibility section of our website and in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, or CR Report.\nInformation contained on our website or in our annual CR Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to\nESG.\nClimate Change\nIn the area of sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks, including current and emerging\nregulations and market impacts.\nIn our CR Report published in July 2022, we published metrics related to our environmental impact for fiscal year 2022. Fiscal year 2023 metrics\nare expected to be published in the first half of fiscal year 2024. There has been no material impact to our capital expenditures, results of\noperations or competitive position associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the\nend of fiscal year 2025, our goal is to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our\noffices and data centers.\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy\nefficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPUs are inherently more energy efficient than other forms of\ncomputing because they are optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. The energy efficiency of our products is\nevidenced by our continued strong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 23 of the top 30 most\nenergy efficient systems, including the top supercomputer, on the November 2022 Green500 list.\nWe plan to build Earth-2, a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Earth-2 will enable scientists, companies,\nand policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate change and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of the end\nof fiscal year 2023, we had 26,196 employees in 35 countries, 19,532 were engaged in research and development and 6,664 were engaged in\nsales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified\nexecutives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\nRecruitment\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be competitive, we have grown our technical workforce and have been successful in\nattracting top talent to NVIDIA.

We have implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees\nfrom traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement.\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. Pulse\nsurveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provide ideas so that we can prioritize areas to take action. The suggestion box is an\nalways-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party\nplatform is designed to protect the identity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive\nresponses.\nWe want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to come and stay. In fiscal year\n2023, our overall turnover rate was 5.3%.\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company\u2019s future. Employees\nreceive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain\nemployees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our shareholders.\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees\u2019 and their families\u2019 physical health, well-being and financial health, including 401(k)\nprograms in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and\nprograms to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and aim to provide\ncomparable support across the regions where we operate. We are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including\nassistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new birth parents, and those who wish to become parents.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees.\nWhen recruiting for new talent or managing current talent, we focus on recruiting, developing, and retaining a more diverse workforce with a\nfocus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates.\nTo this end, we have been:\n\u2022Partnering with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;\n\u2022Assigning dedicated recruiting teams to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process;\n13",

Our competitors\u2019 products, services and technologies, including those mentioned\nabove in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in\nthe future result in lower than expected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, have\nlonger operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, new designs and more design wins,\nand greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or\nprevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, more quickly\ntransition their products, and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could\nharm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or\ndevelop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our AI\ncloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives.\nIf we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would\ncause our revenue to decline.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\nFailure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nWe use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have had and may in the future have long manufacturing lead times.\nWe are not provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a\nquarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced from time to time, there could be a\nsignificant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied\nacross our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future\nenter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our\nbusiness needs or our long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be\nimpeded if components from third parties that are necessary for the finished product are not available. In periods of shortages impacting the\nsemiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously\nexperienced extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity,\nwhich have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same\nrate or at all if our revenue declines.\nDemand for our products is based on many factors in addition to the lead times described above that have caused and/or could in the future\ncause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers\u2019 future demand for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between\nsupply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:\n\u2022competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\n\u2022changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\n\u2022sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of COVID-19 or other global or local health issues;\n\u2022rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n\u2022time to market;\n18",

At the end of fiscal year 2023, purchase obligations and\nprepaid supply agreements represented more than half of our total supply. We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply\ncommitments are misaligned with demand for our products.\nOur demand predictions may not be correct, as we have experienced from time to time. Product transitions are complex and frequently\nnegatively impact our revenue as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners\nprepare to ship and support new products. Our architecture transitions of Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products may\nimpair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions\nand channel partners reducing channel inventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in\nour revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers\nanticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions.\nWhile we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are\ndifficult and prior trends may not continue. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial\nresults may be negatively impacted.\nWe sell most of our products through channel partners, who sell to distributors, retailers, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made\nby our channel partners, distributors, retailers, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end user demand for our products\nhave impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates\nprovided by various downstream parties.\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to\nincrease production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase\nproduction levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner, or our contract manufacturers\nmay experience supply constraints. If we fail to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be\ndamaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed.\nIf we overestimate our customers\u2019 future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our\ncompetitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a\nreduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a\nresult of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our\nproducts as a result of our suppliers\u2019 increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also\nwritten-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-\ncancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make\nchanges to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and\nbecome a greater portion of our total supply while our\n19",

Examples include our Omniverse\nplatform and third-party large language models and generative models. Our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can be\nincorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and\napplications.\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead\ntimes may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events, such as the COVID-19\npandemic. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and\nwhere we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse\nimpact on us.\nThe use of our GPUs for other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted\nand can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, a number\nof years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is\ndifficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision, the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future\nimpact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price\nchanges in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of\nverifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further\nimpact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the\nrecently implemented Ethereum 2.0 merge may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket sales\nof our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously introduced Lite\nHash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided CMP products in an effort to address demand from\ngamers and direct miners to CMP. With the Ethereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and Ada Lovelace architectures no longer include LHR. In\naddition, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized \u201cgray market,\u201d which also makes demand\nforecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.\nAdditionally, we depend on developers and other third parties to build accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.

Failure by\ndevelopers to build applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content\navailable on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our products reduces\nour control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedules and\ncould harm our business.\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques.

profitability.For example, other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to\nrestrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli\noperations, including by economic boycotts.Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other\noperations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures,\nmilitary actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries\nand other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown.In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic\nevent affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue,\nincreases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.All of these risks and conditions could materially\nadversely affect our future sales and operating results.Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.Climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers, partners and vendors.Water and energy\navailability and reliability in the communities where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts\nof extreme weather events.Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to\nwildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the\nability of our employees to work effectively.Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide, and its potential\nto increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause\nus to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations.Although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of\nproperty, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost.Some of our policies\nhave large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim.Losses not covered by\ninsurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.Our business and those of our suppliers and customers, may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits.Regulations such\nas carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to\nmanufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve\nfacilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our\ncustomers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us.These costs and restrictions could harm our\nbusiness and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities.Stakeholder\ngroups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may

Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our\nability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we\npursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If\nwe are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to\npursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition\nless attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our\nbusiness. For example, in February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA\nwould have acquired Arm from SoftBank due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded in\noperating expenses a $1.35 billion charge in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing. Regulators could also\nimpose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate\nacquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold investments in publicly traded\ncompanies, they could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment.\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees,\nincluding key personnel, of the acquired business;\n\u2022diversion of capital and other resources, including management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\n\u2022integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n\u2022coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\n\u2022difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;\n\u2022difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing;\n\u2022stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise\nunable to close an acquisition;\n\u2022legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;\n\u2022potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt\ncovenants or other restrictions;\n\u2022the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n\u2022the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n25",

These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be adversely affected if we\nlose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. With several of\nthese distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales\nwithin our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners\nmay decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other\nway. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can cancel, change or delay product purchase\ncommitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty.

Changes in immigration and\nwork permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition\nfor personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation, and in times of stock price volatility, as we have\nexperienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we\nare highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge\nand smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or\ninterruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over\nfinancial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation and scalability of these processes and systems\nis critical to support our growth. In fiscal year 2023, we continued the implementation of accounting and consolidation functionality related to a\nnew enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system problems upon implementation, such as quality issues or programming\nerrors, could impact our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results.

further restricts the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; restricts the retention of personal information; expands\nthe types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency which can impose\nadministrative fines for noncompliance.Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have each passed their own privacy legislation which differ\nfrom the CPRA and each become effective in 2023.Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local\nlevels.Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in\nproducts and services.If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.Worldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection.The\nEuropean Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR,\ngoverning the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively,\nincluding its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves.If we\nare found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of\nindividuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data.Furthermore, there exists\na proposed European regulation related to AI that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and\ndisadvantage us and require us to change our business practices.In the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other\ncountries.Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws.For example, the GDPR\ngenerally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA.The European Commission released a set of \u201cStandard\nContractual Clauses\u201d designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not\nfound to provide an adequate level of protection, including the United States.While the European Union and United States governments have\nrecently announced an agreement in principle on a new bilateral cross-border transfer mechanism, it is uncertain whether this agreement will be\noverturned in court like the previous two European Union-United States bilateral cross-border transfer agreements.These mechanisms are\nsubject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the\nUnited States.Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data\nresidency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators.For example,\nChina law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and data localization.Data broadly defined as important under China law,\nincluding personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of\nChina, or CAC.Compliance with these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause\nus to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China, or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China.",

effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of\noperations, net income, and cash flows.Further, changes in tax laws may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business.These include changes to\nU.S. tax laws and regulations, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, which implements a 15% minimum tax on book income and a 1% excise tax\non net stock repurchases and parts of which became effective for us in fiscal year 2023.It is possible that these changes, or other tax law\nchanges, could increase our future tax liability or cause other adverse impacts.Most of our income is taxable in the United States, with a\nsignificant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII.If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII\ndeduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and cash flows would be adversely affected.In addition,\nchanges in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD.The OECD recommended changes to long-standing tax principles and\ncontinues to develop new proposals, including allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and establishing a\nminimum tax on global income.These changes, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for\nincome taxes, results of operations and financial condition.Our future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, the expiration of statute of limitations and\nsettlements of tax audits, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses\nnot deductible for tax purposes, the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax valuation allowances, changing\ninterpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the domestic or\ninternational organization of our business and structure.Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in\nour stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur.A decline in our stock price may result in reduced\nfuture tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate, and adversely affect our

Risk\nFactors\u201d, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. \nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics,\nwe have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D\ngraphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data\nscience, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nSupply, Products Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\nOur supply, which includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, has grown significantly due to current\nsupply chain conditions, complexity of our products, and recent reductions in demand. At the end of fiscal year 2023, purchase obligations and\nprepaid supply agreements represented more than half of our total supply. Inventory provisions for excess inventory and purchase obligations\ntotaled $2.17 billion in fiscal year 2023. We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply commitments are misaligned with demand\nfor our products.\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners\nprepare to ship and support new products. We are currently transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and\nGaming products. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel\ninventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. While we have managed\nprior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult and prior trends\nmay not continue.\nWe build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist. Examples include our Omniverse\nplatform and third-party large language models and generative models. Our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can be\nincorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and\napplications.\nNVIDIA AI Cloud Service Offerings\nWe will offer enterprise customers NVIDIA AI cloud services directly and through our network of partners. Examples of these services include\nNVIDIA DGX Cloud, which is cloud-based infrastructure and software for training AI models, and customizable pretrained AI models. NVIDIA has\npartnered with leading cloud service providers to host these services in their data centers.\nWe entered into multi-year cloud service agreements in the second half of fiscal year 2023 to these offerings and our research and development\nactivities. NVIDIA AI cloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone\nsoftware solutions for AI including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE for automotive, and several other software solutions.\nThese new business models or strategies may not be successful and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or as-a-service\nsolutions. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings.\n36",

We are required to transition certain operations out of China (including Hong Kong), including\nresearch and development and supply and distribution operations. We have engaged with customers in China to provide alternative products not\nsubject to the new license requirements, such as our new A800 offering.\nManagement of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our results and competitive position may be\nharmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings, if customers purchase product from competitors, or if\ncustomers develop their own internal solution, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers,\nor if we incur significant transition costs.\nCOVID-19\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we reopened our offices worldwide. We incurred incremental expenses and related in-office costs as we ramped onsite\nservices.\nRestrictions may be imposed or reinstated as the pandemic resurfaces, such as lockdown measures due to COVID-19 containment efforts in\nChina. During fiscal year 2023, end customer sales for our products in China have been negatively impacted by lockdowns and this impact may\ncontinue if lockdowns return. COVID-19-related disruptions have created and may continue to create supply chain and logistics constraints.\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis.\nRussia\nIn fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and later in the year, we closed business operations in Russia. Direct sales to Russia in\nfiscal year 2022 were immaterial. Our revenue to partners that sell into Russia may have been negatively impacted due to the war in Ukraine.\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired\nArm from SoftBank due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination\ncost of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.\nFiscal Year 2023 Summary\n Year Ended\n January 29,\n2023January 30,\n2022 Change\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nRevenue $ 26,974 $ 26,914 \u2014 %\nGross margin 56.9 % 64.9 % Down 8.0 pts\nOperating expenses $ 11,132 $ 7,434 Up 50%\nIncome from operations $ 4,224 $ 10,041 Down 58%\nNet income $ 4,368 $ 9,752 Down 55%\nNet income per diluted share $ 1.74 $ 3.85 Down 55%\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications.

CMP revenue was nominal in fiscal year 2023 and\n$550 million in fiscal year 2022.\nGross margin for fiscal year 2023 declined from a year ago, driven by $2.17 billion of inventory charges largely relating to excess supply of\nNVIDIA Ampere architecture Gaming and Data Center products as compared to the demand expectations for these products, particularly for the\nexpected demand in China. The inventory charges were comprised of $1.04 billion for inventory on hand and $1.13 billion for inventory purchase\nobligations in excess of our demand expectations.\nOperating expenses, which included a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the Arm transaction, were up 50% from a year ago.\nThe increase also reflected compensation, data center infrastructure, and engineering development costs.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $13.30 billion.\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we returned $10.44 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. As of the end of fiscal\nyear 2023, we had $7.23 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023.\nMarket Platform Highlights\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $15.01 billion, up 41% from fiscal year 2022. The strong growth in Data Center revenue was\ninfluenced by hyperscaler and cloud usage of our accelerated computing platforms and networking portfolio. In Data Center, we announced the\nNVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture and began ramping the first products based on the architecture, including the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU.\nThe NVIDIA OVX server reference design launched for digital twins and other Omniverse applications. We completed two new large language\nmodels for cloud AI services \u2014 NVIDIA NeMo LLM and NVIDIA BioNeMo LLM. Additionally, we announced the NVIDIA Spectrum-4 end-to-end\n400Gbps networking platform and began shipping Quantum-2 in December 2022.\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $9.07 billion, down 27% from fiscal year 2022. Gaming results were influenced by the rapid change in\neconomic conditions causing excess inventory with our channel partners. We introduced pricing programs for our channel partners and started\nundershipping GPU supply to the partners so that we could lower inventory in the channel. As we exited fiscal year 2023, we have made\nmeaningful progress in establishing lower inventory levels with our channel partners. In Gaming, we announced the new Ada Lovelace GPU\narchitecture, and introduced the first products based on Ada, including the GeForce RTX 4090, RTX 4080, and RTX 4070 Ti desktop GPUs and\nlaptop GPUs featured in over 170 laptop designs. We introduced NVIDIA DLSS 3 for over 50 games and applications. We brought GeForce RTX\n4080-class performance to the GeForce NOW Ultimate membership tier.\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $1.54 billion, down 27% from fiscal year 2022. Professional Visualization results\nwere influenced by the rapid change in economic conditions causing excess inventory with our OEM partners. In Professional Visualization, we\nadded new NVIDIA Ampere architecture RTX GPUs for workstations. We also announced Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine and Omniverse Cloud\nand released a major update to NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise.\n38",

On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to\ninventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are\nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets\nand liabilities.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the\nAudit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and\nestimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge\ncost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory,\nand for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based\non our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which\nrequires management judgment.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic\nconditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of\nchanging technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes\nin demand due to unexpected end use cases, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times and the\nimpact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of\ncustomer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\nThe overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of\n7.5% in fiscal year 2023 and 0.9% in fiscal year 2022. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory\nbased on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. In the\npast, our manufacturing lead times have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products. We place non-\ncancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to\nsecure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new\nproduct transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and\ncloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification\nof the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance\nobligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling\n39",

Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system,\nhardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are\nperformed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns\nat the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to\nexceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure\nfor product returns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets,\nand marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development\nand are designed to support our partners\u2019 activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to\nrevenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we\nrecognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in\nwhich the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of\nthe estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision\nfor such loss in that period.\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal\nyear by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax\neffects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the\namount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the\napplication of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to\nan anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes\nin other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if\nthe recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax\nexpense in our financial statements accordingly.\nAs of the end of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $1.48 billion and $907 million, respectively, related to capital loss\ncarryforwards, state, and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional\nprojections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not,\nwe would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\n40",

Based on advances in technology and\nusage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four\nto five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. This change in accounting estimate became effective at the\nbeginning of fiscal year 2024. Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment,\nnet in use as of the end of fiscal year 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating income by $133 million as a\nresult of the reduction in depreciation expense.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 is presented below.

Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors,\nincluding wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping\ncosts. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and\nstock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nGross margin was 56.9% and 64.9% for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to $2.17\nbillion of inventory provisions in fiscal year 2023, which consists of approximately $1.04 billion for inventory on hand and approximately $1.13\nbillion for inventory purchase obligations in excess of our current demand projections.\nInventory provisions totaled $2.17 billion and $354 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously\nwritten-off totaled $137 million and $111 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Gains or losses from foreign currency\nremeasurement are included in other income or expense. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net\nincome was not significant for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject\nto exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more\nexpensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to other\ncurrencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international\noperations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely\naffected by a weaker dollar. The primary currency we hedge is Israeli Shekel.\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We\ndesignate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses\non the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related\noperating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.\nWe also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are\ndenominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the\nchange in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign\ncurrency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $112 million and $103 million lower,\nrespectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change\nin hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse\nimpact on income before taxes of approximately $36 million and $41 million as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, respectively. These\nchanges in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency\ndenominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and\nliabilities balances.\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nITEM 8.

Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework, our management\nconcluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 29, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 29, 2023 that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our\nenterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to\naccurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. During the second quarter of fiscal\nyear 2023, we completed the consolidated financial reporting phase of the implementation, which included updating our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures\nor our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the\nfact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations\nin all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within\nNVIDIA have been detected.\nITEM 9B.

We also have audited the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended January 29, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion,\nthe Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial\nreporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to\nthe Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and\nwhether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A\ncompany\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\n52",
        "e2192fad-d04e-469b-bda9-969be5012cf7": "Table of Contents\ndirectors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical\naudit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nit relates.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-\ndown inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company\u2019s inventory provisions\nrelate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company\u2019s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to\nassumptions about future demand and market conditions. As of January 29, 2023, the Company\u2019s consolidated inventories balance was $5,159\nmillion and the Company\u2019s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations balance was $4,920 million, of which a\nsignificant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions\nfor excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by\nmanagement when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing\nassumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing\nprocedures and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s provisions for\nexcess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including controls over management\u2019s assumptions related to future\ndemand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for developing the provisions for\nexcess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s approach; testing\nthe completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s assumptions\nrelated to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions\ninvolved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical\nproduct life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 24, 2023\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2004.\n53",

Fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were both 52-week years. Fiscal year\n2021 was a 53-week year.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.\nPrior period intangible asset gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization in Note 7 have been adjusted to write off immaterial fully\namortized intangible assets as of January 30, 2022.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances\nand transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going\nbasis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts\nreceivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other\ncharges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19. These\nestimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nIn February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and\nusage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three to a range of four to five\nyears, and assembly and test equipment from five to seven years. This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning of fiscal\nyear 2024. Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net in use as of the\nend of fiscal year 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating income by $133 million as a result of the reduction\nin depreciation expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and\ncloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification\nof the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance\nobligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to\ndetermine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance\nobligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are\n59",

Support and extended warranty revenue are\nrecognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer\nprograms and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns\nat the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to\nexceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure\nfor product returns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets,\nand marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development\nand are designed to support our partners\u2019 activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to\nrevenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we\nrecognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in\nwhich the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of\nthe estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision\nfor such loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may\npurchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the\nsoftware. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software\nupdates and upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software\nsupport revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\nCloud Services\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or\nhardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud\nservices is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs.\nProduct Warranties\nWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any\nmanufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at\nthe point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We\nalso accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of\nrestricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a\nMonte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-\nbased PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line\n60",

We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-\nScholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is\nexpensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and\nrevise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings,\ninvolving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and\nservices offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and\nwe cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial\nsettlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation,\ninvestigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates,\nwhich could require us to record additional costs.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured\ninto United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are\nremeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for\nthose expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from\nforeign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal\nyear by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax\neffects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the\namount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the\napplication of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to\nan anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes\nin other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if\nthe recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax\nexpense in our financial statements accordingly.\nAs of January 29, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.48 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, state, and certain other deferred tax\nassets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains,\ntax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership\nchanges. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an\nincome tax benefit during the period.\n61",
        "112f4854-f024-45ab-9c52-ebbf0e5e37cb": "Table of Contents\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Continued)\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the\ntechnical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income\ntax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period,\nusing the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of\ndiluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of\npurchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months\nwhen purchased. We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current\noperations.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These\navailable-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders\u2019 equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes\naccrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and\nrecorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is\nless than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost\nbasis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis.\nAllowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of\nIncome.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their\nrelatively short maturities as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that\nare reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component\nof shareholders\u2019 equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments\nare recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends\non the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or\nlosses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk\nbeing hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is\ninitially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure\nis recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and\naccounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type\nand credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial\ncondition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount\n62",

Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts\ncovered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory\ncosts consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs,\nincluding labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased\nmemory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or\nnet realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to\nexcess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future\ndemand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not\nsubsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future\ndemand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the\nestimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and\naccumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty\nyears. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded\nunder finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in\noperating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOperating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make\nlease payments over the lease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our\nincremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease\nincentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease\nexpense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment\nexist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. \nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the\nreporting units.\nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit\u2019s fair value. The\nincome and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates,\nresidual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain\nassumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. \n63",

We currently amortize our\nintangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic\nbenefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line\namortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When IPR&D projects are\ncompleted, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or\nasset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted\nfuture cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated\nfuture cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the\nestimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be\ngenerated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nand the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets\nacquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these\nnet tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed\nto be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in\nvaluing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the\npresent value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the\nestimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final\ndetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nInvestment in Non-Affiliated Entities\nNon-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment or\nobservable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income. These investments are valued using\nobservable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices\nand inherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities by\nthe investee.\nMarketable equity investments in publicly-held companies are recorded at fair value with the related unrealized and realized gains and losses\nrecognized in other income (expense), net.\nNote 2 - Business Combination\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired\nArm from SoftBank.
