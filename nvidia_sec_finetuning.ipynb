At the end of fiscal year 2023, purchase obligations and\\nprepaid supply agreements represented more than half of our total supply. We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply\\ncommitments are misaligned with demand for our products.\\nOur demand predictions may not be correct, as we have experienced from time to time. Product transitions are complex and frequently\\nnegatively impact our revenue as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners\\nprepare to ship and support new products. Our architecture transitions of Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products may\\nimpair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions\\nand channel partners reducing channel inventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in\\nour revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers\\nanticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions.\\nWhile we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are\\ndifficult and prior trends may not continue. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial\\nresults may be negatively impacted.\\nWe sell most of our products through channel partners, who sell to distributors, retailers, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made\\nby our channel partners, distributors, retailers, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end user demand for our products\\nhave impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates\\nprovided by various downstream parties.\\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to\\nincrease production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase\\nproduction levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner, or our contract manufacturers\\nmay experience supply constraints. If we fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be\\ndamaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed.\\nIf we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our\\ncompetitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a\\nreduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a\\nresult of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our\\nproducts as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also\\nwritten-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-\\ncancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make\\nchanges to the design of future products.

However, it is important to note that the amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than the company's accrued position. As a result, the provisions on tax-related matters may change in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled. Additionally, as of January 29, 2023, the company has not identified any positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months."
