This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is\nqualified in its entirety by express reference to, the applicable provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, which are filed as\nexhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, of which this Exhibit 4.6 is a part, and are incorporated by reference herein. We encourage you to\nread our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) for more\ninformation.\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 8,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock,\n$0.001 par value.\nCommon Stock\nThe holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. The\nholders of common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors, and as a consequence, minority\nstockholders are not able to elect directors on the basis of their votes alone. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any shares of\npreferred stock currently outstanding or issued in the future, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be\ndeclared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our\ncommon stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then\noutstanding preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights and no right to convert their common stock into any other\nsecurities. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Delaware Law and Our Charter Documents\nCertificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nStockholders have no cumulative voting rights.\nOur certificate of incorporation also requires that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly\ncalled annual or special meeting of the stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in writing and that the stockholders may amend our\nbylaws or adopt new bylaws only by the affirmative vote of 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting securities in addition to any vote of the holders of\nany class or series of stock of the corporation required by law or by our certificate of incorporation. A special meeting of the stockholders may be\ncalled by our Chairman, if any, our Chief Executive Officer or a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors.\nThese provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control.\nThe lack of cumulative voting could make it more difficult for our existing stockholders to replace our board of directors as well as for another\nparty to obtain control of us by replacing our board of directors. Since our board of directors has the power to retain and discharge our officers,\nthese provisions could also make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in management.\nThese and other provisions may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management. These provisions\nare intended to enhance the likelihood of continued stability in the composition of our board of directors and in the policies of our board of\ndirectors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change in control. These provisions are\ndesigned to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The provisions are also",

This Award is granted\nto you effective as of the date of grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the \u201cDate of Grant \u201d).
