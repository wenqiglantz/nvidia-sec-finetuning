All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\nWe build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist. Examples include our Omniverse\nplatform and third-party large language models and generative models. Our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can be\nincorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and\napplications.\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead\ntimes may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events, such as the COVID-19\npandemic. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and\nwhere we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse\nimpact on us.\nThe use of our GPUs for other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted\nand can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, a number\nof years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is\ndifficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision, the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future\nimpact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price\nchanges in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of\nverifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further\nimpact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the\nrecently implemented Ethereum 2.0 merge may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket sales\nof our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously introduced Lite\nHash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided CMP products in an effort to address demand from\ngamers and direct miners to CMP.

For instance, a product designed and marketed for a specific purpose might start being used for a completely different purpose, which could significantly alter its demand. An example of this is when gaming GPUs began to be used for digital currency mining, including on blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. This unexpected use case led to changes in demand for these GPUs. Therefore, new or unexpected end use cases can make demand forecasting difficult due to the unpredictability of these changes.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Unexpected or new end use cases can influence product demand by causing unpredictable fluctuations. For example, a product initially created and promoted for a specific function might be repurposed for a different application, leading to a substantial shift in its demand. A case in point is when gaming GPUs, initially designed for gaming, started being utilized for cryptocurrency mining, including on platforms like Ethereum. This unforeseen application resulted in demand variations for these GPUs. Consequently, unexpected or new end use cases can complicate demand prediction due to the unpredictable nature of these shifts."}]}

All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\nWe build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist. Examples include our Omniverse\nplatform and third-party large language models and generative models. Our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can be\nincorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and\napplications.\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead\ntimes may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events, such as the COVID-19\npandemic. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and\nwhere we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse\nimpact on us.\nThe use of our GPUs for other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted\nand can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, a number\nof years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is\ndifficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision, the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future\nimpact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price\nchanges in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of\nverifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further\nimpact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the\nrecently implemented Ethereum 2.0 merge may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket sales\nof our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously introduced Lite\nHash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided CMP products in an effort to address demand from\ngamers and direct miners to CMP. With the Ethereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and Ada Lovelace architectures no longer include LHR. In\naddition, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized \u201cgray market,\u201d which also makes demand\nforecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.\nAdditionally, we depend on developers and other third parties to build accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms. We also\nrely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms such as GeForce NOW. Failure by\ndevelopers to build applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content\navailable on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our products reduces\nour control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedules and\ncould harm our business.\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test\nor package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist\nus in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements.

At the end of fiscal year 2023, purchase obligations and\nprepaid supply agreements represented more than half of our total supply. We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply\ncommitments are misaligned with demand for our products.\nOur demand predictions may not be correct, as we have experienced from time to time. Product transitions are complex and frequently\nnegatively impact our revenue as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners\nprepare to ship and support new products.

Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions\nand channel partners reducing channel inventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in\nour revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers\nanticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions.\nWhile we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are\ndifficult and prior trends may not continue.

Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from\nforeign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in\nall markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or USG, announced new export restrictions and export licensing requirements\ntargeting China\u2019s semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software,\nhardware, equipment, and technology used to develop, produce, and manufacture certain chips, to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and\nRussia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100\nintegrated circuits and our A100X. The new license requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak\nperformance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now\nlicensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses\nin China.\nWe are required to transition certain operations out of China (including Hong Kong), which could be costly and time consuming, and adversely\naffect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period.\nWe have engaged with customers in China to provide alternative products not subject to the new license requirements, such as our new A800\noffering. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the new license requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but\nhave no assurance that the USG will grant any exemptions or licenses for any customer, or that the USG will act on them in a timely manner.\nThe new requirements may have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell\nproducts that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.\nManagement of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our results and competitive position may be\nharmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings, if customers purchase product from competitors, if\ncustomers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG\ndoes not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant transition costs. Additionally, if we\nare unable to sell our alternative product offerings in China, we may have excess inventory, harming our results. Even if the USG grants any\nrequested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we cannot or choose not to fulfill. The new\nrequirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more\ncumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers\nbased in China, Europe, and Israel.\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our\nGaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our environmental, social and governance responsibilities\ncould result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do\nbusiness with us.\nShareholder advocacy groups, certain investment funds, other market participants, shareholders and customers have placed increased\nimportance on the implications of the social and environmental cost of their investments and these parties, as well as government regulators,\nhave focused increasingly on corporate ESG and sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and\nhuman rights.

It is\ndifficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision, the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future\nimpact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price\nchanges in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of\nverifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further\nimpact our ability to estimate demand for our products.

When customers anticipate transitions, there may be a reduced demand for current generation architectures.

Additionally, if channel partners reduce their inventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions, it can also lead to a decrease in revenue.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The anticipation of product transitions by customers and inventory reduction by channel partners can lead to fluctuations or decreases in revenue. If customers foresee changes in product lines, the demand for existing architectures may decline. This can complicate the simultaneous sale of various product architectures during transitions between current and upcoming architectures. Furthermore, if channel partners decide to decrease their stock of older architectures in anticipation of new product launches, this could result in a drop in revenue."}]}

Even if we are able to increase\nproduction levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner, or our contract manufacturers\nmay experience supply constraints. If we fail to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be\ndamaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed.\nIf we overestimate our customers\u2019 future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our\ncompetitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a\nreduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a\nresult of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our\nproducts as a result of our suppliers\u2019 increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also\nwritten-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-\ncancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make\nchanges to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and\nbecome a greater portion of our total supply while our\n19\n\npage_label: 20\nfile_name: nvidia-sec-10k-2022.pdf\n\nTable of Contents\nrevenue has sequentially declined. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\nWe build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist. Examples include our Omniverse\nplatform and third-party large language models and generative models. Our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can be\nincorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and\napplications.\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead\ntimes may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events, such as the COVID-19\npandemic. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and\nwhere we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse\nimpact on us.\nThe use of our GPUs for other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted\nand can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, a number\nof years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is\ndifficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision, the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future\nimpact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price\nchanges in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of\nverifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further\nimpact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the\nrecently implemented Ethereum 2.0 merge may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket sales\nof our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously introduced Lite\nHash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided CMP products in an effort to address demand from\ngamers and direct miners to CMP.

These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications\nor as new versions are released. These risks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in\nour products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production.

Our competitors\u2019 products, services and technologies, including those mentioned\nabove in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in\nthe future result in lower than expected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, have\nlonger operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, new designs and more design wins,\nand greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or\nprevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, more quickly\ntransition their products, and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could\nharm our business.

If the company's estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, this could result in both product shortages and excess inventory, which can significantly harm the company's financial results. The company builds finished products and maintains inventory in advance of anticipated demand, but if they cannot secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address their business needs or if their long-term demand expectations change, their ability to sell certain products could be impeded. This is especially true if components from third parties that are necessary for the finished product are not available.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Insufficient lead-time or capacity from foundry partners can cause substantial discrepancies between supply and demand. This can occur if the company's predictions of customer demand are off the mark, leading to both shortages and surplus inventory, which can severely damage the company's financial performance. The company creates finished products and holds inventory ahead of expected demand, but if they fail to obtain enough capacity commitments to meet their business requirements or if their long-term demand forecasts alter, their capacity to sell certain products could be hindered. This situation is particularly problematic if essential components from third parties for the finished product are unavailable."}]}

We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply\ncommitments are misaligned with demand for our products.\nOur demand predictions may not be correct, as we have experienced from time to time. Product transitions are complex and frequently\nnegatively impact our revenue as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners\nprepare to ship and support new products.

If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial\nresults may be negatively impacted.\nWe sell most of our products through channel partners, who sell to distributors, retailers, and/or end customers.

Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts\ncovered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory\ncosts consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs,\nincluding labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased\nmemory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or\nnet realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to\nexcess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future\ndemand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not\nsubsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future\ndemand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the\nestimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and\naccumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty\nyears. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded\nunder finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in\noperating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOperating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make\nlease payments over the lease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our\nincremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease\nincentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease\nexpense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment\nexist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. \nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the\nreporting units.\nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit\u2019s fair value. The\nincome and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates,\nresidual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain\nassumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. \n63\n\npage_label: 26\nfile_name: nvidia-sec-10k-2022.pdf\n\nTable of Contents\n\u2022negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\n\u2022exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities;\n\u2022potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are\nacquiring; and\n\u2022impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target\u2019s employees, vendors and customers.\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges\nincluding lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic\ndata interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration\npersonnel.

Gains or losses from foreign currency\nremeasurement are included in other income or expense. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net\nincome was not significant for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject\nto exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more\nexpensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to other\ncurrencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international\noperations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely\naffected by a weaker dollar. The primary currency we hedge is Israeli Shekel.\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We\ndesignate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses\non the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related\noperating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.\nWe also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are\ndenominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the\nchange in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign\ncurrency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $112 million and $103 million lower,\nrespectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change\nin hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse\nimpact on income before taxes of approximately $36 million and $41 million as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, respectively. These\nchanges in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency\ndenominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and\nliabilities balances.\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nITEM 8.

We also have audited the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended January 29, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion,\nthe Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial\nreporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to\nthe Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and\nwhether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances.

under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and\nundergoing tax audits in Germany, Israel and India.Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase\nour worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of\noperations, net income,

Inflation Reduction Act, which implements a 15% minimum tax on book income and a 1% excise tax\non net stock repurchases and parts of which became effective for us in fiscal year 2023.It is possible that these changes, or other tax law\nchanges, could increase our future tax liability or cause other adverse impacts.Most of our income is taxable in the United States, with a\nsignificant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII.If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII\ndeduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations,

affect our provision for\nincome taxes, results of operations and financial condition.Our future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or

impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur.A decline in our stock price may result in reduced\nfuture tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate,

Most of the Company\u2019s inventory provisions\nrelate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company\u2019s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to\nassumptions about future demand and market conditions. As of January 29, 2023, the Company\u2019s consolidated inventories balance was $5,159\nmillion and the Company\u2019s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations balance was $4,920 million, of which a\nsignificant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions\nfor excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by\nmanagement when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing\nassumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing\nprocedures and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s provisions for\nexcess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including controls over management\u2019s assumptions related to future\ndemand and market conditions.

The intangible asset was fully\namortized as of January 31, 2021.\n(4)    Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-Royalty Method under the income approach.\n(5)    The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.\nThe fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic\nbenefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nMellanox had an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of\nthe acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $630 million for the fair value of this project, which was\ninitially not amortized. In fiscal year 2023, we commenced amortization of the IPR&D intangible asset.\nSupplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes the combined results of operations for NVIDIA and Mellanox as if the\ncompanies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal year 2020:\nPro Forma\n Year Ended\n January 31, 2021\n(In millions)\nRevenue $ 17,104 \nNet income $ 4,757 \nThe unaudited pro forma information presented above includes adjustments related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, adjustments to\nstock-based compensation expense, fair value of acquired inventory, and transaction costs.

These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be adversely affected if we\nlose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. With several of\nthese distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales\nwithin our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners\nmay decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other\nway. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can cancel, change or delay product purchase\ncommitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may\npurchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase\nour products, all of which may alter partners\u2019 or customers\u2019 purchasing patterns. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in\npurchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries\u2019 trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts\nreceivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and\nrecruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry\u2019s highly competitive\nmarket for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and\nwork permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition\nfor personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation, and in times of stock price volatility, as we have\nexperienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we\nare highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge\nand smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or\ninterruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over\nfinancial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

We currently amortize our\nintangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic\nbenefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line\namortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When IPR&D projects are\ncompleted, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or\nasset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted\nfuture cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated\nfuture cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the\nestimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be\ngenerated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nand the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets\nacquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these\nnet tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed\nto be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in\nvaluing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the\npresent value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the\nestimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final\ndetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nInvestment in Non-Affiliated Entities\nNon-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment or\nobservable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income. These investments are valued using\nobservable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices\nand inherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities by\nthe investee.\nMarketable equity investments in publicly-held companies are recorded at fair value with the related unrealized and realized gains and losses\nrecognized in other income (expense), net.\nNote 2 - Business Combination\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired\nArm from SoftBank.

Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts\ncovered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory\ncosts consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs,\nincluding labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased\nmemory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or\nnet realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to\nexcess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future\ndemand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not\nsubsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future\ndemand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the\nestimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and\naccumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty\nyears. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded\nunder finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in\noperating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOperating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make\nlease payments over the lease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our\nincremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Why are impairments of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges excluded in the financial calculations?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Impairments of long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, are excluded in financial calculations because they are not considered recoverable.

The recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group.

This process ensures that the company's financial statements accurately reflect the value of its assets.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Impairments of long-lived assets, such as goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, are not included in financial calculations due to their non-recoverable nature. The value of these assets is assessed by comparing the asset's book value to the projected undiscounted future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If the book value surpasses its projected future cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the book value of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value. This method ensures the accurate representation of the company's asset value in its financial statements."}]}

The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes\naccrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and\nrecorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is\nless than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost\nbasis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis.\nAllowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of\nIncome.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their\nrelatively short maturities as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022.

The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends\non the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or\nlosses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk\nbeing hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is\ninitially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure\nis recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and\naccounts receivable.

The Company will seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the\nPlan, or any offerings made under the Plan, such authority as may be required to grant Stock Awards and to issue and sell shares of Common\nStock upon exercise of the Stock Awards; provided, however, that this undertaking will not require the Company to register under the Securities\nAct the Plan, any Stock Award or any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award nor seek to obtain such approval if\nthe cost or efforts to obtain the approval is unreasonable in relation to the value of the benefits to be provided under the Plan, as determined by\nthe Company in its sole discretion.

Furthermore, the Company will have no duty or obligation to warn or otherwise advise\nsuch holder of a pending termination or expiration of an Award or a possible period in which the Award may not be exercised.

Proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Awards will constitute general funds of the Company.\nQuery: What is a Performance Stock Award and how is it granted?\nOriginal Answer: A Performance Stock Award is a type of Stock Award that is contingent upon the achievement of certain Performance Goals during a specified Performance Period. It may also require the completion of a specific period of Continuous Service. If a participant's Continuous Service terminates due to death, the Performance Stock Award is considered fully earned at 100% of the target performance level, fully vested as of the date of death, and shares under it will be issued promptly following the date of death. The length of the Performance Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved, and the measure of whether and to what degree these goals have been attained are determined by the Committee or the Board, in its sole discretion. Cash may also be used in payment of Performance Stock Awards, if permitted by applicable law and the applicable Award Agreement.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A Performance Stock Award is a type of Stock Award that is granted based on the attainment of specific Performance Goals within a set Performance Period.
